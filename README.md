###  Following are the guidelines for the  directory struct we need to follow:

*   Create:
models folder - this is where you'll add all of your future models. 

*   Copy resnet.py into this folder, this file should only have ResNet 18/34 models. Delete Bottleneck Class

*   main.py - from Google Colab, now onwards, this is the file that you'll import (along with the model). Your main file shall be able to take these params or you should be able to pull functions from it and then perform operations, like (including but not limited to):

    > training and test loops

    > data split between test and train

    > epochs

    > batch size

    > which optimizer to run

    > do we run a scheduler?

*   utils.py file (or a folder later on when it expands) - this is where you will add all of your utilities like:

    > image transforms,

    > gradcam,

    > misclassification code,

    > tensorboard related stuff

    > advanced training policies, etc etc



###  Hence, following is the directory struct being followed:

![alt text](https://github.com/ojhajayant/EVA8_API/blob/main/EVA8_API_DIR_STRUCT.png "Logo Title Text 1")

> Here are a little details on the above struct:

```
0. cfg.py: This has the default and/or user-supplied top-level configuration values & global-vars.
1. main.py: This is the main script to be run to either find  appropriate LR, train or make inference.

            example usage is as below:
	    
            1. "lr_find" cmd:
	    ```
	    !python /content/EVA8_API/main.py --cmd lr_find
	    ```
	    
	    2. "train" cmd:
	    ```
	    !python /content/EVA8_API/main.py --cmd train --best_lr 0.050499
	    ```
	    
	    3. "test" cmd:
	    ```
	    !python /content/EVA8_API/main.py --cmd test --best_model CIFAR10_model_epoch-20_L1-1_L2-0_val_acc-90.6.h5
	    
	    ```
2. models/resnet.py or others.py...: These are the model-code files, defining the required classes
   for aech neural network.
3. utils folder: This has all the 'utility' code used across.
	> a. utils/preprocess.py: This code is to download & preprocess data (calculate mean/std dev,
	     or applying "torchvision-based" transforms only).
	> b. utils/preprocess_albumentations.py: This code is to apply "albumentations-lib-based" 
	     transforms only.
	> c. utils/train.py: This has the model-training code.
	> d. utils/test.py: This has the model-inference code.
	> e. utils/lr_find.py: This has the LR-rate finder code esp for the code to enable LR-range 
	     test (as required for OCP policy)
	> f. utils/misc.py: This has miscellaneous other funtions to plot curves (accuracy/loss, 
	     L1-penalty, misclassified with without grad-cam display etc.

The downloaded datset or any other intermediate plots or config.txt files are saved to the ./data (or 
user-provided folder)
The models are saved to the ./saved_models (or user-provided folder)
```



Here are the different args values for this different runs:

	> cmd : Either of "lr_find", "train", "test"

	> IPYNB_ENV : True

	> use_albumentations : True

	> SEED : 1

	> dataset : CIFAR10

	> img_size : (32, 32)

	> batch_size : 128
  
        > epochs : 20

	> criterion : NLLLoss()

	> init_lr : 0.0001 (for LR-Range test)

	> end_lr : 0.05 (for LR-Range test)

	> lr_range_test_epochs : 100 (epochs used for LR-Range test)

	> best_lr : 0.504999999999

	> cycle_momentum : True

	> optimizer : <class 'torch.optim.sgd.SGD'>

	> cuda : True

	> dropout : 0.08

	> l1_weight : 2.5e-05

	> l2_weight_decay : 0.0002125

	> L1 : True

	> L2 : False

	> data : ./data/

	> best_model_path : ./saved_models/

	> prefix : data

	> best_model :  CIFAR10_model_epoch-20_L1-1_L2-0_val_acc-90.6.h5
    
    
 The example runs once this has been cloned at the user area:
 
 ```
 !git clone https://git@github.com/ojhajayant//EVA8_API.git
 ```
 
 1. "lr_find" cmd:
 
 ```
 !python /content/EVA8_API/main.py --cmd lr_find
 ```
 
 2. "train" cmd:
 
 ```
 !python /content/EVA8_API/main.py --cmd train --best_lr 0.050499
 ```
 
 3. "test" cmd:
 
 ```
 !python /content/EVA8_API/main.py --cmd test --best_model CIFAR10_model_epoch-20_L1-1_L2-0_val_acc-90.6.h5
 ```
